### **Explanation of RICE Components**

1. **Reach**:
   - **Definition**: The number of users or frequency at which the feature will be used within a specific time frame.
   - **Examples**:
     - **US-004**: Application status updates are relevant to all candidates, hence a higher reach of 1,000.
     - **US-007**: Additional feedback requests are less frequent, resulting in a lower reach of 400.

2. **Impact**:
   - **Definition**: The degree to which the feature will affect user satisfaction or workflow efficiency.
   - **Scale**: Typically rated from 0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive).
   - **Examples**:
     - **US-002**: Real-time feedback access has a high impact of 2.5 on hiring managers' decision-making.
     - **US-010**: Slack integration has a moderate impact of 1.5 on team communication.

3. **Confidence**:
   - **Definition**: The level of certainty regarding the estimates for reach, impact, and effort.
   - **Scale**: Ranges from 0.5 (low confidence) to 1.0 (high confidence).
   - **Examples**:
     - **US-005**: High confidence (0.9) due to well-defined role-based permissions requirements.
     - **US-008**: Confidence of 0.8 based on integration capabilities with external platforms.

4. **Effort**:
   - **Definition**: The total time and resources required to implement the feature, typically estimated in weeks.
   - **Examples**:
     - **US-004**: Requires 2 weeks of effort, reflecting its relatively straightforward implementation.
     - **US-003**: Needs 5 weeks due to the complexity of automated scheduling systems.

5. **RICE Score Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{RICE Score} = \frac{\text{Reach} \times \text{Impact} \times \text{Confidence}}{\text{Effort}}
   \]
   - **Example Calculation for US-004**:
     \[
     \text{RICE Score} = \frac{1,000 \times 1.5 \times 0.9}{2} = 675.0
     \]
