# Prompt 1

I have all the information about a new system we have to create in the markdown file I've attached to this conversation.

I would like to work in the following outcomes, but please ask me any question before working in each of the outcomes:
1. As a Product Owner, generate the main User-Personas of the system.
2. As a Product Owner and Business Analyst, generate 10 User stories to start implementing this LTI system. This is the template I want you to follow:
   * ID: <ID>
   * Title: "As  [User-Persona-Type], I want [the User story action] to [obtain a benefit]".
   * Description: A short description in natural languageof the features that the user wants.
   * Acceptation Criteria: Specific conditions that must be accomplished to consider the User Story as "donde". This acceptation criteria should follow the Gherkin template: “Given” [initial context], "when” [action in the system], “then” [expected result].
   * Additional notes.
3. Propose me a good prioritization framework.
4. Prioritise the User Stories to build the Product Backlog.

(I attach the markdown file with the information about the system - LTI_ADFR.md)

## ChatGPT answer

I’ll go through the file and get a comprehensive understanding of the requirements to help with each of your requested outcomes. I'll review the document and get back to you with any clarifying questions.

The document begins by describing an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** specifically tailored for the IT recruitment market, emphasizing the system's goals and key differentiators from competitors. It outlines the following core details:

1. **ATS Overview**:
   - This ATS is designed to streamline IT recruitment with advanced configuration options for end-to-end workflows.
   - It will include features like **real-time collaboration**, **AI-driven screening**, and **customizable workflows** to address the unique needs of hiring IT professionals.

2. **Competitor Analysis**:
   - Notable ATS competitors are **TeamTailor**, **Greenhouse**, **Lever**, **SmartRecruiters**, and **Workday Recruiting**. The document compares their strengths and limitations, highlighting the ATS's planned advantages, like enhanced customization, deeper AI integration, and real-time collaboration tailored for IT hiring.

Based on this information, let me know if I should proceed with **creating personas** for this specialized ATS. I could start with roles like **recruiters**, **hiring managers**, **IT candidates**, and **administrators**. Or let me know if you'd like further clarification on specific aspects.

# Prompt 2
What do you mean with the role "Administrator"?

## ChatGPT answer
By "Administrator," I mean a user persona responsible for configuring and managing the ATS system. This person would typically handle tasks such as setting up user roles, managing permissions, customizing workflows, integrating the ATS with other software (like HR or payroll systems), and overseeing system updates or troubleshooting.

For this ATS, an Administrator might perform actions like:
- **Customizing workflows** specific to IT recruitment (e.g., unique stages for technical assessments).
- **Setting up AI-driven filters and criteria** for candidate screening.
- **Managing user access** and permissions for recruiters, hiring managers, and other team members.
- **Integrating** the ATS with tools that hiring teams use (e.g., Slack for notifications or coding platforms for assessments).

The Administrator persona ensures the ATS operates smoothly and meets the specific needs of IT recruitment teams. Let me know if this aligns with your vision for the system or if you'd like adjustments.

# Prompt 3
Ok, proceed with user personas

## ChatGPT answer
Let me know if these personas fit the vision for your ATS or if there are any additional details or other user types you’d like to consider.

# Prompt 4
It's ok, let's continue

## ChatGPT answer
Now, I’ll move on to creating 10 User Stories for the ATS system, following the template you provided. I’ll focus on features that align with the needs of each persona we’ve developed.

Give me a moment to draft these.

Here are the 10 initial user stories based on the personas we established:

---

Let me know if you’d like to refine any of these stories or if they align well with the planned features.

# Prompt 5
YEs, go ahead

## ChatGPT answer
Next, let's establish a **prioritization framework** to help you organize these user stories effectively. A common and effective approach in product development is to use the **MoSCoW method**, which categorizes features into four priority levels:

1. **Must-Have**: Essential features that the product cannot function without.
2. **Should-Have**: Important but not critical; these add value and improve usability.
3. **Could-Have**: Nice-to-have features that enhance the product but are not necessary.
4. **Won't Have (for Now)**: Features that are out of scope for the initial release but may be considered later.

Another solid approach is **RICE scoring** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort), which can provide a numerical priority by evaluating each story based on:
- **Reach**: How many users are impacted by the feature.
- **Impact**: The degree of positive effect the feature has.
- **Confidence**: How confident we are about the accuracy of the reach and impact estimates.
- **Effort**: The estimated resources needed to implement the feature.

**Recommendation**: Given the early stage and the critical features for an ATS, the **MoSCoW method** could be efficient, as it helps focus on delivering essential functionality first. 

Please let me know if you’d like to proceed with MoSCoW or try RICE scoring for more granularity. Then, I’ll prioritize the user stories accordingly to create your Product Backlog.

# Prompt 6
Let's try RICE

## ChatGPT answer
Great choice! I'll assign **RICE scores** to each user story to determine their relative priority. Here's a quick look at how I'll approach scoring:

1. **Reach**: Estimated number of users or frequency of use. Higher for commonly used features like candidate filtering or application tracking.
2. **Impact**: Scaled on a qualitative scale from 3 (massive) to 0.25 (minimal), estimating the feature's influence on user satisfaction and workflow efficiency.
3. **Confidence**: Scaled from 1 (high confidence) to 0.5 (low confidence) based on the clarity and feasibility of the requirement.
4. **Effort**: Time and resources required, estimated in weeks or days. Lower values reflect less effort, which boosts the priority.

I'll calculate the RICE score for each feature as:  
**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

Let's go through each user story and apply the RICE scoring.

Here is the prioritized Product Backlog based on the RICE scores:

1. **US-004** (675.0) - Application status updates for candidates.
2. **US-002** (400.0) - Real-time feedback access for hiring managers.
3. **US-005** (375.0) - Role-based permissions for system administrators.
4. **US-001** (360.0) - Candidate filtering based on IT skills for recruiters.
5. **US-006** (340.0) - Candidate interaction tracking for recruiters.
6. **US-008** (270.0) - In-ATS technical assessments for candidates.
7. **US-003** (255.0) - Automated interview scheduling for recruiters.
8. **US-007** (240.0) - Additional feedback request option for hiring managers.
9. **US-010** (240.0) - Slack integration for system administrators.
10. **US-009** (180.0) - Hiring metrics reports for recruiters.

This order reflects each feature's relative value to users, helping us focus on delivering the most impactful items first. Let me know if you’d like adjustments or further details on any item!

# Prompt 7
Can you provide me the RICE values table for the user stories?

## ChatGPT answer
Here is the RICE values table for the user stories:
Certainly! Below is a comprehensive RICE Values Table for each of the 10 user stories. This table includes the individual components of the RICE framework—Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort—along with the calculated RICE Score for each user story.

# Prompt 8
Ok, let's focus in the first User Story, US-004. I want you to provide a task list for the implementation of that user story.  These are the task types:
- Features: Descriptions of functionalities that the product should have. Directly linked to user stories
- Technical Tasks: Infrastructure improvements, code refactoring, etc.
- Bugs/Errors: Detected or known problems that need to be solved.
- Enhancements: Suggestions and improvements based on user feedback.
- Research (spike): it is an element of the Product Backlog oriented to research or experimentation, whose purpose is to obtain the necessary learning to implement the functionality requested by the Product Owner or customer. In these cases, the user story is usually divided in 2, one related to the research, and a later one related to the feature to be implemented.

And I want you to follow this template for all the tasks:

- Title Clear and Concise
A brief summary that reflects the essence of the task. It should be descriptive enough for any team member to quickly understand what the ticket is about.
